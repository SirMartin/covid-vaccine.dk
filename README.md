# COVID-19 Vaccine

## Warning 24/02/2021
This project is no longer active because the danish goverment launched a dashboard with more or less same information that the one I created.

<a href="https://covid19.ssi.dk/overvagningsdata/vaccinationstilslutning" target="_blank">Information about the dashboard and the data in more open formats.</a>

https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/1c7ff08f6cef4e2784df7532d16312f1 - Access to the SSI dashboard.

## Introduction

Hi this is a fork of the [midudev](https://github.com/midudev/covid-vacuna) repository.

I just translated to Danish and English, and adapted to use the data from the Danish Goverment.

## How to run it locally?

You need `Node.js` at least version 12 and make the next steps from a terminal:

```
npm install # install dependencies
npm run dev # run development enviroment
```

## Can I help?

Please feel free to make pull request, or issues if you find something that can be fixed.
