# COVID-19 Vaccine

Hi this is a fork of the [midudev](https://github.com/midudev/covid-vacuna) repository.

I just translated to Danish and English, and adapted to use the data from the Danish Goverment.

## How to run it locally?

You need `Node.js` at least version 12 and make the next steps from a terminal:

```
npm install # install dependencies
npm run dev # run development enviroment
```

## Can I help?

Please feel free to make pull request, or issues if you find something that can be fixed.
